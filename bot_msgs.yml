    How <u><strong>believable</strong></u> do you think each of these perspectives is?
  valued:
    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    How much does <u><strong>this perspective match your deeper values </strong></u>? <br/>
    (e.g. the kind of person you ideally want to be, the kind of place you ideally want the world to be.)
    If you the perspective is <i>not relevant</i> to your values OR if the perspective is <i>incongruent</i> with your values, respond with a lower score.
    If you the perspective is aligned with your values, respond with a higher score.
  relevance:
    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    How <u><strong>relevant</strong></u> is this perspective to the issue you're facing? <br/>
    Aside from whether you agree with the perspective, it may be more or less connected to what you see as the actual issue. 
    Here we are asking about how much this perspective even speaks to the problem at hand (regardless of whether you think the persective is true or not.)
